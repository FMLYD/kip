# Kernel Point Imputation (KPI)

This repository contains the official implementation of **KPI: A Generalized Iterative Imputation Framework for Model Adaptation and Oracle Feature Utilization**.

## üîç Overview
![KPI Method Overview](./method.png)

Iterative imputation is widely used to handle missing data by sequentially imputing each feature using the others as predictors. However, existing methods suffer from:

1. **Model Misspecification**: Applying the same model structure to all features ignores the heterogeneity in their underlying data-generating processes.
2. **Underutilization of Oracle Features**: Fully observed (oracle) features are treated the same as partially missing ones, leading to suboptimal imputations.

To address these issues, we propose **Kernel Point Imputation (KPI)**, a **bi-level optimization framework** that:

- **Adapts model forms per feature** using functional optimization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
- **Leverages oracle (fully observed) features** to provide informative supervision signals during the outer optimization stage.

## üß† Key Contributions

- A **flexible model adaptation** mechanism that avoids uniform parametric assumptions.
- A **bi-level learning framework** that exploits oracle features for more accurate and robust imputations.
- **Superior performance** across various real-world benchmarks with heterogeneous and partially observed datasets.



## üß™ Reproducing Results

### 1. Environment Setup
Install Python 3.10 and required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Data Preparation
Obtain preprocessed datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu), then place the downloaded data in the `./dataset` folder.

### 3. Train and Evaluate
Experiment scripts for all benchmarks are provided under the `./scripts/` folder. Reproduce results with example commands like:
```bash
bash scripts/bt.sh
```
### üîß Optional: Docker Environment 

For users who prefer containerized environments, we provide a lightweight `Dockerfile` that sets up a Conda-based environment named `kpi`. This environment includes Python 3.10 and several pre-installed base packages.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The Docker image includes **only a partial installation** of the dependencies. You still need to activate the Conda environment and install the remaining packages via `requirements.txt`.

#### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t kpi-conda .
```

#### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run {your args} -it kpi-conda /bin/bash
```
For example, to mount the current directory and work inside it:
```
docker run  --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app -it kpi-conda /bin/bash
```


#### 3. Inside the container

##### Activate the conda environment
```
conda activate kpi
```
##### Install the remaining dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run your experiment
```
bash scripts/bt.sh
```

This setup is useful for users who want a consistent, containerized environment with Conda.
